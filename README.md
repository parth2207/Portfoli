## XYZ Chips Manufacturing Network Configuration

### Project Overview
- **Project Name:** XYZ Chips Manufacturing Network Configuration
- **Description:** This project involved the design and configuration of a network for XYZ Chips Manufacturing. The goal was to distribute departments, configure VLANs, implement switching and routing, and set up virtualization services.
- **Technologies Used:** Networking, VLANs, Switching, Routing, Virtualization, AD DC, DNS, DHCP, IIS, FTP.

### Project Details
- **Network Configuration:** We designed and configured a network for XYZ Chips Manufacturing, including VLAN segmentation for different departments.
- **Virtualization Services:** Implemented essential services like Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC), DNS, DHCP, IIS, and FTP to support the network infrastructure.

### Challenges Faced
- During the project, we encountered challenges, such as a network outage due to a command mistake (shutdown instead of no shutdown), which required troubleshooting and valuable learning experiences.

### Key Takeaways
- **Command Accuracy:** We learned the importance of command accuracy in networking configurations, where a simple mistake like "shutdown" instead of "no shutdown" can lead to network disruption.
- **Teamwork:** Collaboration and teamwork were crucial to overcoming challenges and successfully completing the project.
